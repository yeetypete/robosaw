# Logbook Entry 9/25/21

## Logistics
- Switched from ME360 to EC463 to allow all team members from different majors to be in the same section when working on the robosaw.

## Design Ideas

### Automating Mitre Saw Chopping Action
- A linear actuator can be used to bring down mitre saw blade and cut workpiece.
- Linear actuators generate a high amount of force for their size
- The downwards movement of the saw blade is approximately linear.
- To accommodate for nonlinear movement of saw blade linear actuator must be mounted on a pivot.
- Mounting on the side opposite of the AC motor is better because there is more room, but will need to make sure that the linear actuator does not get in the way when the saw is angled for bevel cuts.
- Purchasing a finer blade with more teeth will decrease cutting force if necessary.

## Issues to Address
- Need to order mitre saw ASAP to have access to dimensions and test workpiece friction against mitre saw base, cutting force, etc.
- Will the design incorporate a stock feeding system where stock can be loaded from a stack automatically?
