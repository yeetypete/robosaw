## Design

### RoboSaw Frame
- Decided to construct a frame around the miter saw to enable easier mounting of design components including roller intake system and fence clamping mechanism.
- Frame will be constructed using 80/20 extruded aluminum to allow for easier rapid prototyping and development.

### Roller Intake
- Roller on the outtake side of the RoboSaw will be eliminated and replaced with a flat clamping plate to hold down wood to eliminate unnecessary complexity.
- Cut wood stock will simply be pushed out by the remaining uncut portion as it is being fed through the miter saw.

## Todo
- Continue CAD modeling of roller intake system, fence clamping mechanism and miter saw frame.
- Calculate maximum clamping force required to hold the wood stock down at the outtake. This will determine the required torque of the torsion springs.
