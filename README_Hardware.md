### Mechanical
RoboSaw uses a roller-intake mechanism to feed lumber through the frame and to the Metabo miter saw. The intake clamps the wood from the top using a steel roller arm attached to two pairs of 10 lb gas springs. The gas springs damp the intake so that it conforms around the wood without snapback if the wood is removed.

The saw 
The turntable mechanism, which allows the RoboSaw to perform angled cuts, is still a work in progress. Currently, the mechanism uses a rack and pinion gear setup. The rack is mounted to the stationary back of the miter saw turntable and the pinon is mounted to the front 

## RoboSaw Blade Actuation Mechanism
This section will describe the RoboSaw Actuation Mechanism and its various components. This mechanism is responsible for performing the cut quickly and safely.

### Hardware
The RoboSaw Blade Actuation mechanism is comprised all aluminum components. These were either ordered or milled in the EPIC facilities using the provided CAD and CAM files.

Parts included in the CAD:
 
1. Plate.SLDPRT-The main structural component of the mechanism

2. 2313N39_Corner Machine Bracket.STEP - Right angled bracket connected the the components together.

3. Actuator_Mount.SLDPRT- The component the linear actuator attaches to.

All of the screws, bolts, and nuts can be found in the Bill of Materials for the LInear Actuator Mechanism.

### Notes for Assembly

- Both Plate.SLDPRT and the Actuator_Mount.SLDPRT were milled out of 3/8 inch aluminum. This was done to increase the rigidity of the entire mechanism during the cutting process.

- The mounting plate was mounted using existing holes  and threads on the stock saw. We mounted the plate using a 3/8-16 X 5 inch bolt through the center hinge of the saw and a 5/16-18 X 1 inch screw.

- All of the milled components and linear actuator mount were secured together using 1/2-20X1-1/2 inch screws and 1/2-20 nuts.

- The linear actuator was mounted using a mount purchased online to the Actuator_Mount.SLDPRT component. A M6X0.75mm, 40mm long screw was used to attach the other end of the linear actuator to an existing threaded hole on the saw.

- In order for the linear actuator to work properly, you must remove the stopper screw on the side that allows the saw to return to its original position. If this is not removed the linear actuator mechanism will experience high loads that can result in a bolt shearing, parts breaking, and potential injury.
