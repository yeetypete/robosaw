## Logistics
- Tested completed RoboSaw mechanisms including roller-intake, and wood stock clamping mechanism.

## Testing Results
- Roller-intake is not stiff enough because of 3D printed parts interferes with clamping cams when it is in the lowered position. 
- Roller-intake belt skips because of lack of stiffness.
- Wood stock clamping mechanism works well but the springs on the cams may need to have more torque, especially during the initial clamping movement. If a stronger spring is needed, the shaft diameter of the cam mounting point must increase.
- Currently it is difficult to manually remove wood stock because of the cam's locking effects.
- Blade cover slightly hits the front of the Frame. Either move miter saw back or add a stopper to prevent the blade cover from extending all the way.

## Todo
- Decrease wood stock clamping cam height so that the cams do not interfere with the roller-intake.
- Explore redesign of roller-intake replacing torsion springs with damped gas springs. The gas springs should provide a more consistent clamping force across all lumber sizes. Additionally the gas springs will ensure that the roller-intake does not violently swing backwards after the wood is pushed through all the way.
- Explore moving the motor underneath the RoboSaw base and directly driving the wheel. This will eliminate the timing belt skipping issue and complexity from the roller-intake design. The motor would now be stationary and the roller-intake would act as an idler clamping roller.
- Add a mechanical linkage between both cams which can be actuated using a lever to release the wood stock manually in case no further cuts need to be performed.
- Complete Kilachand Budget proposal and list all expenditures for this year.
