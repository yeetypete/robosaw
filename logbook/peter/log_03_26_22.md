# Logbook Entry 03/26/22
## Logistics
- Tested new camera setup using three cameras. We are able to position the wood with a much higher degree of accuracy (1/16 inches or less) and meet our specifications
- New camera mounts need to be adjusted to fit cameras properly and center camera mount needs to be redesigned to fit color camera.
- Ordered parts for electronics enclosure and cable management.
## Design
- Designed turntable tilting mechanism and ordered metal stock and all parts.
- The turntable mechanism will now have the motor with a bevel gear move around a stationary bevel gear mounted to the center bolt in the miter saw turntable. The center bolt will be replaced with a custom machined part to allow the mounting of the motor. The motor will have an encoder and as a result know its relative position. Limit switches will be used to calibrate the motor center position upon powerup.
- All components for the turntable mechanism will be made out of steel and aluminum for rigidity. The theroretical maximum turning speed will be 180 degrees/second.

## Todo 
- Machine the turntable mechanism parts.
- Mount enclosure, PSU and manage cables
- Test the RoboSaw cutting actual wood next week.
