# Logbook Entry 02/12/22
## Logistics
- Decided to put turntable mechanism into backlog and focus on first achieving blade actuation
## Design
### Roller Intake Mechanism
- Finished force and torque calculations to spec gas springs for roller intake. Actuation force will require 5 or 10 lb variant to achieve a force of 4.54 and 9.07 lb respectivley for a 2x4 or 2x6. The clamping force changes depending on the angle of the intake mechanism. see [intake_calcs.ipynb](../../mech_calcs/intake_calcs.ipynb) for more details.

## Todo
- Long build session next week
- Laser cut acrylic base plates
- Machine roller intake sides with waterjet cutter
- Cut 80/20 extrusion to update RoboSaw frame to fit new components.
- Place large McMaster order for Linear Actuator and final roller intake parts.
