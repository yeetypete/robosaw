## Logistics
- Prepared the RoboSaw for critical design review.
- Computer vision system is able to detect the line and move in the wood until it reaches the line
- Critical design review outcomes:
    - Remove cams and replace them with motors tilted inwards. When the motors spin part of their force will be directed against the back fence and clamp the wood.
    - Improve computer vision system by adding more cameras. One camera for detecting the height and dimensions of the wood, one for measuring the angle of the drawn line, and one mounted to the shield guard to line up the drawn line with the blade.

## Design tasks
- Designed camera mounts for the two new camera systems
- Designed tilted motor mount to replace cam mechanism
