The Engineering Addendum is quick-start documentation written to any future team that may continue to work on your project. This is where you outline the gotchas of your project, types of things to look out for, the current state of the project, etc.  The purpose of README.md is to save any future team weeks of detective work just to get to where you are today. Think back to what types of things you had wished you knew earlier, doing future teams a favor by passing that knowledge along.  

# RoboSaw Engineering Addendum

## Introduction
RobSaw is a collaborative robot miter saw that can cut lumber to size autonomously by detecting a line drawn on the wood with a pen or pencil using computer vision, and then making a cut. This README details the intricacies and nuances of the project and serves as a general guide for getting started with creating a new RoboSaw.

## Current State of the Project
Currently RoboSaw is able to perform cross cuts on 2x4, 2x6, and 4x4 lumber up to 8 ft in length. A control pendant is used to interface with the RoboSaw, containing an emergency stop button, a run button, and a cut button. The run button is pressed move the wood through the RoboSaw until the computer vision system, which uses three separate cameras, detects a line. Once a line is detected, the cut button can be pressed to perform a cut, and the
