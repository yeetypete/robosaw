## Completed Tasks
- Finished creating a 3D model of the Metabo miter saw which details all possible mounting points for the wood stock clamping mechanism, saw actuation mechanism, and the spring roller intake.
- Measured forces required to actuate the miter saw blade and rotate the table using an analog force gauge.

## Design
### Wood Stock Clamping Mechanism
- Discussed wood stock clamping mechanism design with Pavel. Proposed design modifications including putting slots on either side of the kerf plate. The stock clamping fence will have a corresponding pin which follows the motion of the slot in case the miter base is rotated. Gas springs will be used to compress the fence against the wall.
- Wood stock should also be clamped from the top with a spring loaded fence attached to the spring roller intake. This mechanism should be placed on both the intake and the outtake.
- 80/20 rails can be used for the attachment points of the gas springs. This will allow adjustments to be quickly made and tested for the prototype without having to modify the part itself. 
### Spring Roller Intake
- Observed possible mounting points for miter saw spring roller intake to be the miter saw base mounting and extension wing mounting holes. To ensure spring roller intake rigidity, both will likely have to be used.
## Todo
- Begin design of wood stock clamping mechanism and spring roller intake in CAD.
- Using measured forces for actuating miter saw spec the and order the corresponding actuators.
