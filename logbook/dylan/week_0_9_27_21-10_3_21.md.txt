Week of 9/27/2021

First week with fully approved project and assembled team. Github repository started which will contain code, logs, etc.

- General Design considerations

	- Interface built-in switch with relay or bypass switch altogether depending on model of saw and complexity of electronics

	- Need some sort of sensor to determine distance stock has traveled down the saw for motor feedback

TODO:

- Order saw, once the saw comes in we can start ordering everything else, need to know the electronics and dimensions of the saw.

- Flash rPI4 in preperation for openCV testing/development.
