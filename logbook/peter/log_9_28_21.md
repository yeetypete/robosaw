# Logbook Entry 9/28/21

## Logistics
 - Created GitHub for [robosaw](https://github.com/yeetypete/robosaw) and Google Drive for CAD files. Because CAD files are encoded in binary, they do not handle git merges well, so it is best to store them in a shared volume like Google Drive.
 - Discussed presentation with team members.
 
## Design

### Torsion Spring Roller Intake
 - Explored an intake design using rollers with torsional springs to hold workpiece in place and move it through the mitre saw assembly.
- Allows the design to accomplish two functions with one mechanism:
    1. Clamps down the workpiece using the torsion springs
    1. Moves the workpiece through the mitre saw assembly using the motorized rollers.
- Torsional springs obey Hooke's law and their torque varies following $\tau = r \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle in radians.
- Rollers are best motorized using stepper motors because stepper motors have the highest torque at rest. 
- Stepper motors can also allow for open-loop positional control if there is no step skipping and the friction between the rollers and the workpiece is enough to prevent shifting.


## Issues to Address
- There will be a minimum cut size for the robosaw due to the intake design. The stock intake needs to be designed to make the minimum cut size as small as possible.
- What are the maximum and minimum widths of stocks that the design can accommodate?
