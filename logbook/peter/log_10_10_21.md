## Logistics
- Ordered force gauge to allow us to calculate the requirements for motors, springs and linear actuators required for the RoboSaw design.
- Began working on CAD for RoboSaw wood stock clamping mechanism.

## Design
### Wood Stock Clamping Mechanism
- The wood stock clamping mechanism must clamp the wood at all times, including during the cut.
    - The saw blade housing can have a mechanism attached to it that clamps the wood as the saw blade comes down and cuts the wood stock
    - The clamping mechanism can be mounted across from the miter saw fence, but it must adjust with the movement of the miter saw when it is being adjusted for miter cuts. If using two separate clamping components is to be avoided the mechanism must have a slit in it allowing the blade to pass through.
- Gas springs can be used to apply force against the wood (easier to mount and more options available than mechanical springs).

### Spring Roller Intake
- The spring roller intake does not need to push through the wood stock at both ends if the stock fence is sufficiently long and supports the wood at both sides of the miter saw. The uncut piece will then push the cut pieces out the other end. 
## Todo
- 3D model essential components of the miter saw to make designing parts easier.
