# Logbook Entry 02/21/22
## Logistics
- Began using Trello to organize team tasks.
- Tested roller intake mechanism with Dylan. The intake works properly and can even push warped pieces of wood. A cover needs to be printed for the roller intake so that the 4x4 does not catch on the standoff rods.
- Wheel height may need to be raised for better grip on the wood.
- The initial position of the cams should be adjustable. Redesign cam brackets with a slot for the stopper instead of a screw hole to enable adjustability.
- Cam lever release mechanism is essential to allow easy unclamping of wood. Moved from backlog to todo.
- Redesign camera mount bracket to ensure that the camera lens is flush with the mount protective lip.

## Todo
- Test the entire intake mechanism once the computer vision and motor control components are integrated together.
