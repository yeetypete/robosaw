# Logbook Entry 11/05/21

## Logistics
- Had second design review. Teo, our team lead for this week could not attend because he had a concussion.
- Discussed progress on mechanical and software aspects of RoboSaw. 

## Design
- Redid torque calculations for miter miter saw rotating table base to account actual motor position rather than the position of the measured tangential force. This ensured a more accurate estimate of the required torque the motor must exert.
- Realized that the wood stock must be supported by rollers throughout the majority of its length. A miter saw stand commonly used by construction workers at the jobsite will be ordered to address this issue.
- Conveyer rollers will be added close to the miter saw base to support the wood in the vertical direction as it passes through the intake.

## Todo
- Based on the new torque requirements, order a stepper motor for the rotating miter saw base.
