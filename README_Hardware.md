### Mechanical
RoboSaw uses a roller-intake mechanism to feed lumber through the frame and to the Metabo miter saw. The intake clamps the wood from the top using a steel roller arm attached to two pairs of 10 lb gas springs. The gas springs damp the intake so that it conforms around the wood without snapback if the wood is removed.
