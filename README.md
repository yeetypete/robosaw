The Engineering Addendum is quick-start documentation written to any future team that may continue to work on your project. This is where you outline the gotchas of your project, types of things to look out for, the current state of the project, etc.  The purpose of README.md is to save any future team weeks of detective work just to get to where you are today. Think back to what types of things you had wished you knew earlier, doing future teams a favor by passing that knowledge along.
