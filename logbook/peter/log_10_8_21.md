# Logbook Entry 10/08/21

## Logistics
- Presented on 10/07/21 and received feedback from audience leading to the potential addition of two new features:
    1. An emergency stop button attached to a pendant so that an operator can stop RoboSaw without having to approach it.
    1. Add the ability for the camera to detect anomalies during the cutting process such as wires, nails in the wood, etc.
- Picked up Metabo 10" miter saw which will act as the platform upon which cut automation mechanisms and features will be built.

## Design
- Removed blade from miter saw and examined motor wiring circuit.
- Took measurements of miter saw critical dimensions to allow the design of the wood stock intake to begin in CAD. 
- Performed intake motor torque requirement calculations in [mech_calcs.ipynb](../../mech_calcs/mech_calcs.ipynb). More accurate results for torque values can be obtained with real world force tests using a force gauge.

## Issues to Address
- Where to position the cameras and mount the electronics. Currently the electronics for the miter saw are located inside the handle, meaning that they move with the saw blade. It could be advantageous to place the remaining electronics next to this location as long as having the electronics move during the cut is not an issue.

## Todo
- Continue designing wood stock intake and wood clamping mechanism.
