## Design

### Stock Clamping Mechanism
- Add a spring-loaded clamp on either side of the miter saw blade. The clamp will come down with the blade and apply a consistent clamping force as close as possible to the cut location during the cut. When the cut is finished the clamping mechanism will raise up when the saw blade is lifted by a linear actuator.
