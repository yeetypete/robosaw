## Logistics
- Divided up mechanical design of robosaw with Pavel. Pavel will focus on motorizing the angling of the miter saw for bevel cuts and motorizing the chopping action of the saw. I will focus on the intake mechanism design and wood stock clamping system.
 
## Design

### Torsion Spring Roller Intake
- Can move aluminum backplate on mitre saw forward to allow wood stock to contact side roller better.
- Will allow the intake to accommodate wood stock of a smaller width, 2x2 for example.
- Downsides are that the miter saw will not be able to make as wide crosscuts.
- Can also have one side of the side roller clamp be unanchored to allow a smaller size of wood stock to be properly secured.
- Is the mechanism stiff enough to handle the torque?
- Add inclined plane behind intake rollers so that the wood edge cannot catch on the roller itself when it is being fed in.
- Make rollers such that the radius of the roller is equal to the width of the maximum wood stock height and width the design can accommodate.

## Issues to Address
- How to ensure the intake mechanism doesn't catch on the leading edge of the wood stock?
