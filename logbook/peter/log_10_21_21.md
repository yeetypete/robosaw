# Logbook Entry 10/21/21

## Logistics
- Self-deadline of 10/24/21 for ordering ALL large parts for RoboSaw mechanical design. The preliminary design of all RoboSaw components must be completed before the deadline.

## Design
### Spring Roller Intake
- Found grippy 40A durometer [intake rollers](https://www.andymark.com/products/2-25-in-hd-compliant-wheels?Bore=3%2F8+Hex&Durometer=40A&via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzVhZjhlMjgzYmM2ZjZkNWUzNmYyMzk2YQ) to be used for the spring roller intake. Because each roller is only 1 in wide they can be stacked in parallel with each other to form a wider roller. The intake rollers use a 3/8 in hex bore to transmit torque from a hex shaft to the roller.
- To feed the correct lengths for preset cuts blind stepper motor position steps will not be precise enough because of potential for slip as a result of the friction-based contact with the wood stock. An encoder can be placed on the spring roller intake stepper motor or a separate rotary encoder can be mounted to the side and lightly contact the wood stock as it passes through the miter saw.
- It is likely better to have a separate rotary encoder or have a secondary sensor placed at a known length from the location of cut determine when to begin counting rotations of the rotary encoder. Otherwise it is likely that at the moment the wood is being first fed into the RoboSaw, the position tracking will be inaccurate as the spring roller intake adjusts itself around the wood stock.
- An optical CMOS sensor (similar to the ones found in computer mice) can be used to optically determine how much wood is being fed out.

## Todo
- Begin preliminary CAD design of all RoboSaw components and complete by 10/24/21.
